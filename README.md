After starting so many different python projects it started becoming a nuisance to create a new virtual environment from the command-line everytime. So I decided to create a simple GUI application to make it a little easier to manage all my virtual environments. This application allows you to create new environments with the click of a button and opens a new terminal with a selected environment with the click of the mouse. Enjoy!
